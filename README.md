# Application Development CI/CD Proof of Concept (POC)

This repository serves as a proof of concept (POC) for implementing CI/CD pipelines and GitOps practices for application development. It is structured to demonstrate various deployment strategies, continuous integration pipelines, and GitOps principles using tools like Helm, Tekton, and ArgoCD.

## Repository Overview

The repository is organized into several subfolders, each with a specific purpose. Below is a summary of the key components and their respective documentation:

### Example Application Quarkus Repository
- **Folder**: `application-quarkus-discounts-repo`
- **Purpose**: Contains the source code and resources for a Quarkus-based application.
- **Key Files**:
  - `pom.xml`: Maven configuration for building the application.
  - `Dockerfile.jvm`: Docker configuration for building the application.
  

### Continuous Integration Repository
- **Folder**: `continuous-integration-repo`
- **Purpose**: Implements CI pipelines for Java-based applications using Tekton and ArgoCD.
- **Key Features**:
  - Tekton pipeline definitions for building, packaging, and deploying Java applications.
  - ArgoCD application configurations for managing pipeline resources.
- **Setup Instructions**: Includes steps for configuring image repositories, deploying ArgoCD applications, and setting up webhooks.

### Helm Chart for Java Applications
- **Folder**: `helm-chart-java-repo`
- **Purpose**: Contains a Helm chart designed for deploying Java-based applications on Kubernetes. It provides features like service configuration, replica management, autoscaling, and resource customization.
- **Key Files**:
  - `Chart.yaml`: Metadata for the Helm chart.
  - `values.yaml`: Default configuration values for the chart.
  - Templates for deployment, service, and ConfigMap resources.
- **Usage**: Includes instructions for installing, customizing, and uninstalling the Helm chart.

### GitOps Repository
- **Folder**: `gitops-repo`
- **Purpose**: Manages the deployment of applications across multiple clusters and environments using GitOps principles.
- **Key Features**:
  - `apps`: Application-specific configurations for each cluster and environment.
  - `environments`: Shared configurations for different environments.
  - `clusters`: Cluster-specific configurations.
  - `argo-cd-applications`: ApplicationSet configurations for ArgoCD.
- **Example**: Demonstrates how to use Helm charts and ArgoCD for multi-cluster deployments.


## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive example of setting up CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows for application development. Each subfolder is documented with detailed instructions and examples to help you get started with deploying and managing applications effectively.
